HOW IT WORKS NOW:
================

STEP 1 - ENTER BUDGET INFO:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 💰                                 │
│ Enter Your Annual Project Budget   │
│                                    │
│ $ [3,400,000]                      │
│                                    │
│ How many positions do you need?    │
│ [7]                                │
│                                    │
│ Target Average Margin (%)          │
│ [55] (minimum - we'll maximize!)   │
│                                    │

STEP 2 - ADD POSITIONS:
You add positions one by one...

Position 1/7 ✓
Position 2/7 ✓
Position 3/7 ✓
...
Position 7/7 ✅ DONE!

After 7th position:
→ Form locks automatically
→ "✅ All Positions Added" message
→ Can't add more positions
→ Can delete to add different ones

STEP 3 - CALCULATOR MAXIMIZES MARGIN!

Example:
Budget: $3,400,000/year
7 positions with total cost: $1,536,240/year

Target margin: 55% (you entered)
At 55% margin, revenue needed: $3,413,867

BUT your budget is $3,400,000!

Calculator logic:
- Budget allows: ($3,400,000 - $1,536,240) / $3,400,000
- That's 54.8% margin possible
- Close to target but slightly under

So calculator uses FULL budget:
→ Revenue: $3,400,000
→ Cost: $1,536,240
→ Profit: $1,863,760
→ Margin: 54.8% ✓

If budget was $5,000,000 instead:
- Margin possible: ($5M - $1.5M) / $5M = 69%!
- Calculator would give you 69% margin! 🎉
- Uses FULL budget to maximize profit!

THE NEW LOGIC:
=============

OLD (Stop at target):
  If target = 55%
  Budget = $5M
  Cost = $1.5M
  → Calculator gives 55% margin
  → Only uses $3.33M of budget
  → Wastes $1.67M! ❌

NEW (Maximize profit):
  If target = 55%
  Budget = $5M
  Cost = $1.5M
  → Calculator calculates: ($5M - $1.5M) / $5M = 70%
  → Gives you 70% margin! 🎉
  → Uses FULL $5M budget
  → Maximizes profit! ✓

POSITION LIMIT FEATURE:
======================

Why it matters:
→ You know you need exactly 7 people
→ Don't want to accidentally add 8th
→ Clear stopping point

How it works:
1. Enter "7" positions needed
2. Counter shows: "0 / 7"
3. Add position: "1 / 7"
4. Add position: "2 / 7"
...
7. Add position: "7 / 7" ✅
8. Alert: "🎉 All 7 positions added!"
9. Form locks automatically
10. Can delete positions to swap them

Example:
Added 7 positions but made mistake?
→ Delete the wrong one
→ Counter shows "6 / 7"
→ Form unlocks automatically
→ Add correct position
→ Counter shows "7 / 7" ✅

REALISTIC EXAMPLE:
=================

Scenario 1: TIGHT BUDGET
Budget: $2,000,000
Cost: $1,536,240
Possible margin: ($2M - $1.5M) / $2M = 23%

Calculator:
→ Uses full $2M budget
→ Gives 23% margin (best possible)
→ Shows warning: "Below 55% target"
→ Suggests: "Increase budget or reduce costs"

Scenario 2: GOOD BUDGET
Budget: $3,400,000
Cost: $1,536,240
Possible margin: ($3.4M - $1.5M) / $3.4M = 55%

Calculator:
→ Uses full $3.4M budget
→ Gives 55% margin (hits target!)
→ Shows: "✅ Target achieved"

Scenario 3: GENEROUS BUDGET
Budget: $5,000,000
Cost: $1,536,240
Possible margin: ($5M - $1.5M) / $5M = 69%

Calculator:
→ Uses full $5M budget
→ Gives 69% margin (WAY above target!)
→ Shows: "🎉 Exceeded target by 14%!"

MARGIN DISTRIBUTION:
===================

Individual margins still vary (10-65%):
Position 1: 41% margin
Position 2: 57% margin
Position 3: 18% margin
Position 4: 63% margin
Position 5: 17% margin
Position 6: 65% margin
Position 7: 65% margin

Average: 55%+ (or higher if budget allows!)
